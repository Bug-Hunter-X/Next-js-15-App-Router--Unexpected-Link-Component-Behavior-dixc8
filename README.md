# Next.js 15 App Router: Unexpected Link Component Behavior

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in Next.js 15's App Router when using the `Link` component for navigation.  The issue manifests as unexpected behavior during transitions between pages, especially concerning dynamic routes or client-side updates.

## Bug Description

The `Link` component, while generally reliable, can exhibit unpredictable behavior under specific circumstances within the App Router. Navigation may fail, or the UI may not reflect the navigation correctly.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate between the Home and About pages. Observe any inconsistencies in navigation or UI updates.

## Solution

The solution often involves carefully reviewing how the `Link` component is used, ensuring that href values are correct and that any relevant context is properly handled.  This may involve checking for typos in route names or ensuring that data fetching is correctly integrated with the navigation process.  In some cases, restructuring the application's routing may be necessary.
